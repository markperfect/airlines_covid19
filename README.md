# Investigating the Impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. Airline Industry

This project uses Department of Transportation data and Twitter data to analyze the changes wrought on the U.S. airline industry by COVID-19. It is found that:

1. Key airline metrics, such as the number of passengers, experienced sharp reversals in long-term trends. 
2. The changes to the industry were widespread, yet differences by location have emerged.
3. As sentiments have changed toward travel, the brand of the airline industry has been impacted.
